    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      To make this chicken carbonara pasta bake, you’ll need just seven simple
      ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pancetta:</b> This chicken carbonara pasta bake recipe starts with 10
        ounces diced pancetta.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spaghetti:</b> You’ll need one 16-ounce package of spaghetti to make
        six servings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Egg yolks:</b> The traditional rich carbonara sauce is made with four
        large egg yolks.
      </li>
      <li><b>Parmesan:</b> You’ll need two cups of Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Heavy cream:</b>1 cup heavy cream, make sure the heavy cream is room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chicken:</b> 2 cups cooked chicken breast. This recipe is a great use
        for leftover cooked chicken breast.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Parsley:</b> 1 tablespoon italian parsley. Fresh Italian parsley is
        optional, but it adds a nice pop of color and flavor.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
        Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook pancetta in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until lightly
        browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil spaghetti in lightly salted water for 5 minutes. Drain pasta and
        reserve 2 cups pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add egg yolks to a large mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour 1 1/2 cups hot pasta water over egg yolks, whisking
        vigorously, making sure to whisk constantly so eggs do not scramble.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk in Parmesan cheese, then heavy cream.</li>
      <li>
        Add cooked pasta, pancetta, and chicken to the sauce, toss to combine.
        Transfer pasta mixture to prepared dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until hot and sauce has thickened, 20 minutes, stirring halfway
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, stir and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes allowing sauce
        to continue to thicken. Additional pasta water can be added, as desired,
        for a saucier pasta.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
