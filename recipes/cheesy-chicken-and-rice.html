      <li>Yield: 1 (9*3-inch) dish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 cups rice</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix (such as Lipton)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread rice into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 1 cup
        Cheddar cheese over rice; season with black pepper and salt. Arrange
        chicken evenly atop rice-cheese layer. Dot chicken evenly with rounded
        teaspoons of cream of chicken soup. Pour water over chicken, then
        sprinkle evenly with onion soup mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Check rice for doneness; if water
        is already completely absorbed, add 1/2 cup more water to keep mixture
        moist. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and
        the juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over the dish to serve.</li>
    </ol>
